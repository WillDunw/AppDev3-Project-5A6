# Social Media Application 

## Goal
- Essentially our goal is to create the new age Instagram without all of the adds and useless features that clog up the application such as; going to the main feed screen to view your follow requests, likes, etc. Instagram started boxing in their most useful features deep in their application. We plan on bringing those features out and making them more visible and easier to access. 

## Quick-start
- We didn't publish our application on a website as of yet, but that does not mean you cannot download it. Once you click the following link [Social Media App](https://github.com/WillDunw/AppDev3-Project-5A6).
  1. Once you're on the page click the < > Code button
  2. You will then be presented with a dropdown menu, click the download zip button.
  3. Save the file to your preferred destination.
  4. Once the app is loaded in, click build (the hammer icon) or Control+F9	on windows / Command+F9
  5. When the wait time is over, you will be greated with the home screen, which is the feed page 
  6. You will see accounts, which are profiles on the app.
  7. You can click the sign up/ sign in button at the top right to get started.
  8. Once you're logged in / signed up the following feature will be available to you. 

## Milestone 3
- We completed a lot of functionality for the application. Users can now comfortably use the without any issues.
  1. Users can now sign up and sign in to the application.
  2. Users can now create posts and view them on the feed page.
  3. Users can now view other users profiles and posts.
  4. Users can comment and on posts
  5. The ability to see posts that you have liked and created.
